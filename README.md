## Known Issues
1. why glog.debug doesn't work?
2. action output bounding shoube integrated in tf
3. need a method to generate target graph
4. how to compare two unlabeled, weighted graph
5. how to give scores to subgraph
6. the environment obstacles positions generated randomly

## Todo List
1. setup not tested
2. need shell scripts with params
3. ddpg_baselines result looks good, but some values cant understand yet

## Change Log
24/05/2020: added ddpg from baselines training with the marl_fc_env, got workable result, so maybe something wrong with maddpg
